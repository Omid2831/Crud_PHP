This project establishes a MySQL database to store and manage roller coaster information across Europe. It consists of three key steps:
--

Step 1: Database Creation
-
Aim: Set up the foundational database, named rollercoaster-2408c.

Description: This step creates the database where all roller coaster records will be stored, ensuring a unique and organized data structure.
--
Step 2: Table Setup
-
Aim: Define the table structure to hold detailed roller coaster data.

Description: The table RollercoasterOfEu is created with fields for each roller coasterâ€™s name, park, country, top speed, height, status, and timestamps.
--
Step 3: Data Insertion
-
Aim: Populate the table with initial data.

Description: Adds a sample entry for "Red Force" in Spain, demonstrating how roller coaster records are structured within the database.
--
Each step builds upon the last, laying the groundwork for effective CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) within the rollercoaster-2408c database.
